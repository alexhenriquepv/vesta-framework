## ðŸ§  About project

The **Event-Driven Agent Framework** is a Python framework designed to build intelligent agents that process events 
from sensors, wearable devices, or any external system.  
It combines **ProcessingTasks**, which transform raw events into structured insights, and **ActionTasks**, 
which allow the agent to trigger external actions (e.g., turning on alarms, sending notifications, or interacting with third-party APIs).
